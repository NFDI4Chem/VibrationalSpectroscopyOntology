## Link to [CHARISMA Wiki equivalent]
The CHARISMA project wiki contains terms for Raman specific and related concepts identified by domain experts of the CHARISMA team. In order to reuse this expertise, we've agreed with the CHARISMA team to link between the terms in this wiki and the terms in VISBO. For example https://wiki.charisma.ideaconsult.net/wiki/Item:Q57 is mentioned as definition source for the VIBSO class *region of interest*.

## Examples
