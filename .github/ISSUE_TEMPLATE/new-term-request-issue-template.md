For new term requests (NTRs), please provide the following information:

## Preferred term label

## Synonyms

(e.g., Absent spleen)

## Textual definition

The definition should be understandable even for non-specialists. Include a PubMed ID to refer to any relevant article that provides additional information about the suggested term.

## Link to [CHARISMA Wiki equivalent](https://wiki.charisma.ideaconsult.net/wiki/List_of_all_terms)
The CHARISMA project wiki contains terms for Raman specific and related concepts identified by domain experts of the CHARISMA team. In order to reuse this expertise, we've agreed with the CHARISMA team to link between the terms in this wiki and the terms in VISBO. For example the link https://wiki.charisma.ideaconsult.net/wiki/Item:Q188 should be mentioned as definition source whenever a NTR is based on a term from the CHARISMA wiki.

## Suggested parent term

Please look in the hierarchy in a browser such as the [NFDI4Chem TS](https://terminology.nfdi4chem.de/ts/ontologies/vibso)

## Examples

Please provide a more detailed description that examplifies how the term is supposed to be used, in terms of what it is suppose to repesent (e.g. a concept or a relation).
