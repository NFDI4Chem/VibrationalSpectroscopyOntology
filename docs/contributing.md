# How to contribute to VISPRO

As decribed [here](index.md#vision-and-development-approach), VISPRO makes use of a TSV template pipeline in order to lower the bar for domain experts, who have no to little experience in ontology editing, to contribute.

The basic idea is to make a new term request by filling out [this issue template](https://github.com/NFDI4Chem/VibrationalSpectroscopyOntology/blob/main/issue_template.md), which will be used automatically by GitHub at the moment, whenever a [new issue](https://github.com/NFDI4Chem/VibrationalSpectroscopyOntology/issues/new) is opened. This issue should then be used to engage the community in discussing the label, definition, position in the hierarchy as well as possible axiomatization. Once the discussion has reached a consensus, someone, most likely the person who opened the issue, will have to make a pull request in which the discussed changes to VISPRO will be implemented. Editing new terms is best done within  [this TSV template](https://github.com/NFDI4Chem/VibrationalSpectroscopyOntology/blob/main/src/templates/vispro_terms.tsv).
