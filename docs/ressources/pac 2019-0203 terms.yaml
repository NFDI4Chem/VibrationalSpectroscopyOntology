      defn: "Technical term for changing the shape of a mathematical function, electrical signal, or optical transmission to remove or smooth a discontinuity at the edges, literally meaning ‘removing the foot’. Note 1:Originally, ‘apodization’ described the procedure by which Fourier-transform infrared spectra are corrected for the side lobes that appear in the wings of spectral bands when the interferogram is not zero at its limits, by multiplying the interferogram prior to Fourier\n\t\t\t\ttransformation by a weighting function that is zero at its limits (see Fourier transform spectroscopy). Its use has broadened in recent years to include weighting functions that are not zero at their limits. Note 2:Apodization is also used for manipulating FIDs (free induction decay) to enhance specific components of the signal, for example to improve signal-to-noise or resolution, and is achieved by application of specific shapes to the FID, e.g., in nuclear magnetic\n\t\t\t\tresonance spectroscopy: exponential, Gaussian or sine-bell; in infrared spectroscopy: Boxcar, Happ-Genzel, Norton-Beer, cosine."

   - title: "31 dephasing"
      defn: "phase relaxation"
      - "Loss of coherence between the upper and lower states of a transition. Note 1:The term ‘dephasing’ arises from the density matrix formalism that is used in a phenomenological approach to simplify the description of the relaxation dynamics of a molecule coupled to its surroundings. Note 2:Dephasing leads to either homogeneous broadening or inhomogeneous broadening depending on the system. The continually changing intermolecular interactions cause a shift of the frequency of the\n\t\t\t\tintramolecular vibration. If these interactions change much more slowly than the amplitude of this shift, heterogeneous broadening results and causes a Gaussian band. If these interactions change much faster than the amplitude of this shift, homogeneous broadening occurs and the observed spectral band is a notionally narrowed Lorentzian band. In the general case, the broadening due to dephasing is neither homogeneous nor heterogeneous and the line shape is neither Gaussian\n\t\t\t\tnor Lorentzian."

In each case, angle tuning is used to match the laser wavelength to the Bragg diffraction condition.

Some authors use the linear decadic absorption coefficient or molar decadic absorption coefficient to calculate\n\t\t\t\tcircular dichroism instead of the absorption index. Note 2:Like the absorption indices (kL, kR), circular dichroism changes with wavenumber. Note 3:Most biological molecules, including proteins and nucleic acids, are chiral and show circular dichroism in their ultraviolet absorption bands, which may be used as an indication of secondary structure. Metal centres that are bound to such molecules, even if they have no inherent chirality, usually exhibit CD in absorption bands\n\t\t\t\tassociated with ligand-based or ligand-metal charge-transfer transitions.
